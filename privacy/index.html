            <h2>Effective Date: 28 May 2023</h2>

            <p>Thank you for choosing Carit, an app that provides assistance with love problems through an AI assistant.
                This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use our
                app. We value your privacy and are committed to ensuring the security of your data. By using Carit, you
                consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

            <h4>1.1 Account Creation:</h4>
            <p>When you create an account on Carit, we only allow login through Google. As a result, we receive limited
                information from your Google account, which may include your name, email address, and profile picture.
            </p>

            <h4>1.2 Subscription Status and User Tokens:</h4>
            <p>We also collect and store information about your subscription status and user tokens. This information is
                used solely for managing your subscription and ensuring a smooth user experience.</p>

            <h4>1.3 Local Storage:</h4>
            <p>Chats and messages within the Carit app are stored locally on your device. We do not have access to these
                conversations, and they are not transmitted or stored on our servers.</p>

            <h4>1.4 Responses:</h4>
            <p>
                When sending a message it gets processed by our servers and a response is sent. Once the response is sent all content gets deleted on our backend.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Use of Information</h3>

            <h4>2.1 Personalization and Assistance:</h4>
            <p>The information we collect is used to personalize your experience with the AI assistant within the Carit
                app.
                It helps us provide relevant advice and recommendations tailored to your specific love problems.</p>

            <h4>2.2 Subscription Management:</h4>
            <p>The subscription status and user tokens are used for managing your subscription, providing access to
                premium
                features, and maintaining a seamless subscription experience.</p>

            <h3>3. Data Storage and Security</h3>

            <h4>3.1 Firebase Storage:</h4>
            <p>The limited data we receive from your Google login is securely stored on Firebase servers. We implement
                appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your information from unauthorized access,
                loss, or alteration.</p>

            <h4>3.2 Local Device Storage:</h4>
            <p>Chats and messages are stored locally on your device and are not shared with us or any third parties. We
                strongly recommend that you take necessary precautions to secure your device and prevent unauthorized
                access
                to your conversations.</p>

            <h3>4. Information Sharing</h3>

            <h4>4.1 No Data Sharing:</h4>
            <p>We do not share your personal information with any third parties, except as explicitly mentioned in this
                Privacy Policy.</p>

            <h4>4.2 Legal Requirements:</h4>
            <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, or if we believe in good faith that such
                disclosure is necessary to comply with legal obligations, protect our rights or property, or prevent
                fraud
                or illegal activities.</p>

                our servers.</p>
